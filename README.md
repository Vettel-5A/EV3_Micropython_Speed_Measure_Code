## EV3 Micropython Program To Measure Speed of RC Cars

# General Description
This program uses two ultrasonic sensors spaced approximately 1 foot apart to measure the speed of an RC car. The picture below shows the LEGO Technic Formula 1 RC car model I built to go along with this program.

# How It Works
The two ultrasonic sensors on the ends of the speed trap are spaced approximately 1 foot apart. When the first ultrasonic sensor senses an entity within a foot of the sensor, a stopwatch in the program begins.  This stopwatch comes to a stop when the second ultrasonic sensor detects an object within a foot of the sensor. Finally, the elapsed time is used to calculate the speed of the car.
